# Server Status Indicator Implementation

## Overview

This document tracks the implementation, issues, and resolutions for the MT9 EMA Dashboard's server status indicator component. The server status indicator provides users with visibility into the API server's status and the ability to start it when offline.

## Current Implementation (as of May 8, 2025)

### Server Status Component

- **Component:** `<BasicServerStatus />`
- **Location:** `/mtfema-dashboard/src/components/basic-server-status.tsx`
- **Position:** Top-right corner of the dashboard interface
- **Features:**
  - Real-time status monitoring (online, offline, starting, checking)
  - Visual status indicator with color-coding
  - Interactive tooltip with detailed information
  - Server start capability when offline
  - Automatic status polling (every 10 seconds)

### Technical Implementation

1. **Status Checking:**
   - Performs API health checks to `/api/status` endpoint
   - Implements timeout handling to prevent hanging requests (2s timeout)
   - Degrades gracefully when server is offline

2. **Server Management:**
   - Uses the launcher API at `http://localhost:5001/launcher/start` to trigger server startup
   - Implements polling to detect when server comes online after startup request
   - Provides user feedback during startup process

3. **UI Features:**
   - Color-coded status indicator (green for online, red for offline, blue for starting)
   - Information tooltip on hover
   - "Start Server" button when server is offline
   - Proper positioning to avoid UI conflicts

## Implementation Timeline

1. **Initial Implementation (May 7, 2025):**
   - Created enhanced server status component with Radix UI tooltip
   - Positioned in top-right corner of dashboard

2. **Dependency Issues (May 8, 2025):**
   - Encountered unresolved module errors with Radix UI tooltip
   - Created custom SimpleTooltip component to replace dependency

3. **Build Issues (May 8, 2025):**
   - Next.js build errors due to cached references to deleted files
   - Created stub implementations to satisfy build dependencies

4. **Final Implementation (May 8, 2025):**
   - Implemented dependency-free BasicServerStatus component
   - Fixed positioning to prevent overlap with theme switcher
   - Enhanced visual design and interactivity
   - Improved error handling and server startup mechanism

## Issues and Resolutions

### 1. Tooltip Dependency Issues

**Problem:** The Radix UI tooltip dependency caused unresolved module errors.

**Resolution:** 
- Implemented a custom, lightweight tooltip solution without external dependencies
- Created a standalone SimpleTooltip component for use throughout the application

### 2. Build System Caching Issues

**Problem:** Next.js continued to reference deleted files in its build cache, causing build failures.

**Resolution:**
- Created placeholder stub implementations of required components
- Ensured build system could find all necessary imports
- Implemented a clean, dependency-free replacement

### 3. UI Positioning Conflicts

**Problem:** The server status indicator overlapped with the theme switcher in the UI.

**Resolution:**
- Adjusted positioning from `right-4` to `right-16` in Tailwind classes
- Added visual enhancements (border, shadow) for better separation
- Improved overall visibility of the component

### 4. Server Startup Functionality Issues

**Problem:** The server start functionality didn't reliably trigger server startup.

**Resolution:**
- Enhanced error handling with timeouts and better logging
- Improved the feedback loop during server startup process
- Fixed event handling to prevent event propagation issues
- Added detailed logging for troubleshooting connection problems

## Next Steps and Future Improvements

1. **Enhanced Error Messages:**
   - Implement more specific error messages for different failure scenarios
   - Provide troubleshooting guidance in the tooltip

2. **Server Configuration Options:**
   - Add advanced server configuration options in the tooltip
   - Allow users to restart or stop the server when online

3. **Persistent State Management:**
   - Implement persistent state storage to remember last known server status
   - Add user preferences for automatic server startup

4. **Visual Enhancements:**
   - Further improve visual design based on user feedback
   - Consider adding server health metrics (memory usage, request latency, etc.)

5. **Integration with System Notifications:**
   - Add browser notification support for server status changes
   - Implement background monitoring even when dashboard isn't open

## Technical References

### API Endpoints

1. **Server Status Check:**
   - `GET http://localhost:5000/api/status`
   - Returns 200 OK when server is online

2. **Launcher Status Check:**
   - `GET http://localhost:5001/launcher/status`
   - Returns information about the launcher service availability

3. **Server Start Request:**
   - `POST http://localhost:5001/launcher/start`
   - Initiates server startup process

### Component Dependencies

The current implementation has **zero external dependencies**, making it more robust and less prone to dependency-related issues. It relies only on:

- React's built-in hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback)
- Standard fetch API for network requests
- Tailwind CSS for styling

This approach ensures maximum compatibility and minimum maintenance burden.
