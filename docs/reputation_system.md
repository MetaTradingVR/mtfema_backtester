## How to Use the Reputation System

### Basic Usage

To award points to a user for an action:

```python
from mtfema_backtester.community.reputation import award_points, ActionType

# Award points for creating a forum post
award_points(
    user_id="user123",
    action_type=ActionType.FORUM_POST_CREATE.value,
    context={"post_id": "post456"}
)
```

### Getting User Reputation Data

To get a user's current reputation status:

```python
from mtfema_backtester.community.reputation import get_user_reputation

# Get user's reputation data
reputation_data = get_user_reputation("user123")

print(f"Points: {reputation_data['points']}")
print(f"Level: {reputation_data['level']}")
print(f"Rank: {reputation_data['rank']}")
```

### Getting User Badges

To get the badges a user has earned:

```python
from mtfema_backtester.community.reputation import get_user_badges

# Get user's badges
badges = get_user_badges("user123")

for badge in badges:
    print(f"{badge['icon']} {badge['name']}: {badge['description']}")
```

### Generating Leaderboards

To generate a leaderboard:

```python
from mtfema_backtester.community.reputation import generate_leaderboard

# Generate a reputation leaderboard
reputation_leaderboard = generate_leaderboard(
    category="reputation",
    timeframe="month",
    limit=10
)

# Generate a signals leaderboard
signals_leaderboard = generate_leaderboard(
    category="signals",
    timeframe="all_time",
    limit=5
)
```

## Integration with Other Community Features

The reputation system integrates with other community features:

### Forums Integration

When a user creates a forum post, likes a post, or has their post marked as a solution, the forums system automatically awards reputation points:

```python
# Example from forums.py
from mtfema_backtester.community.reputation import award_points, ActionType

def create_post(user_id, title, content, category):
    # Create the post...
    
    # Award points for creating a post
    award_points(user_id, ActionType.FORUM_POST_CREATE.value, {"post_id": post_id})
    
    return post
```

### Signals Integration

When a user creates a signal or has their signal followed, the signals system awards reputation points:

```python
# Example from signals.py
from mtfema_backtester.community.reputation import award_points, ActionType

def create_signal(user_id, symbol, direction, entry_price, stop_loss):
    # Create the signal...
    
    # Award points for creating a signal
    award_points(user_id, ActionType.SIGNAL_CREATE.value, {"signal_id": signal_id})
    
    return signal
```

## Technical Implementation

The reputation system is implemented as a singleton with thread-safety to ensure consistent data across the application. Data is persisted to disk for reliability across application restarts.

### Data Storage

Reputation data is stored in JSON files:

- `user_reputation.json`: Contains user points, levels, badges, and action counts
- `action_history.json`: Contains detailed history of user actions

These files are located in the `.mtfema/community/reputation` directory by default.

## Future Enhancements

Planned enhancements to the reputation system include:

1. **Achievement Notifications**: Real-time notifications when users earn badges or level up
2. **Advanced Analytics**: Detailed analytics on user contributions and community engagement
3. **Custom Badges**: Allow community administrators to create custom badges
4. **Badge Showcasing**: Allow users to showcase selected badges on their profile
5. **Automated Challenges**: Time-limited challenges with special badges and rewards
