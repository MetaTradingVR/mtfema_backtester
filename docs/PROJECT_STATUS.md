## üìã Implementation Progress

### **2025-05-06**: Web Interface Implementation

Added a modern, interactive web interface using Streamlit for the backtester:

1. **Core UI Framework**: Created a responsive Streamlit application with custom styling and a multi-tab interface for different visualizations and controls.

2. **Parameter Controls**: Implemented sidebar controls for symbol selection, date ranges, timeframe selection, and strategy parameters with appropriate defaults and validation.

3. **Visualization Integration**: Connected the previously developed visualization components (Extension Map, Signal Timeline, etc.) to the web interface.

4. **Dashboard Components**: Added specialized UI components including performance metrics cards, equity curve visualization, trade tables, and parameter forms.

5. **Data Fetcher**: Created a data retrieval module for fetching market data from Yahoo Finance with support for multiple timeframes and automatic indicator calculation.

The web interface provides a complete environment for configuring backtests, running them, and analyzing results with rich visualizations. All components are modular and designed for future extensions.

### **2025-05-06**: Advanced Visualization Components

Added four new interactive visualization components for comprehensive strategy analysis:

1. **Extension Map**: Visualizes extensions across all timeframes with a heatmap interface, allowing traders to quickly identify multi-timeframe confluence areas. Uses color coding to represent extension direction and magnitude.

2. **Signal Timeline**: Shows the evolution of trading signals across timeframes, with markers color-coded by direction (long/short) and sized by confidence. Includes detailed hover information for signal analysis.

3. **Progression Tracker**: Visualizes how trades progress through the timeframe hierarchy using a Sankey diagram. Shows the flow from entry timeframe to subsequent target timeframes, with link thickness proportional to frequency.

4. **Conflict Map**: Displays detected timeframe conflicts with visual indicators for different conflict types (Consolidation, Direct Correction, Trap Setup). Helps traders understand where risk adjustments were applied.

All visualizations use Plotly for modern, interactive display and can be saved as standalone HTML files. A test script has been added to demonstrate these visualizations using sample data.
