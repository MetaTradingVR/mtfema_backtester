# Multi-Timeframe 9 EMA Extension Strategy Backtester

A comprehensive backtesting system for the Multi-Timeframe 9 EMA Extension trading strategy, built with Python 3.13.

## Recent Enhancements

The project has been enhanced with several key improvements:

1. **[Enhanced Documentation](enhancements.md#1-enhanced-documentation)**: Comprehensive documentation with architecture overview, installation guide, and usage examples.

2. **[Testing Framework](enhancements.md#2-testing-framework)**: Complete pytest setup with unit, integration, and performance tests.

3. **[Performance Optimization](enhancements.md#3-performance-optimization)**: Numba JIT-accelerated backtester with vectorized operations.

4. **[Continuous Integration](enhancements.md#4-continuous-integration)**: GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing and code quality checks.

5. **[Enhanced Configuration Management](enhancements.md#5-enhanced-configuration-management)**: Flexible configuration system with YAML/JSON support and environment variables.

## Overview

This project implements a complete backtesting system for a trading strategy based on price extensions from the 9-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) across multiple timeframes. The strategy looks for significant extensions away from the 9 EMA, followed by retracements and reclamations, with confluence across different timeframes.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Timeframe Analysis**: Combines signals from different timeframes (1m → 5m → 10m → 15m → 30m → 1h → 4h → daily → weekly → monthly)
- **Comprehensive Backtesting**: Full P&L calculation, drawdown analysis, and trade statistics
- **Advanced Visualization**: Charts showing entries, exits, equity curve, and key metrics
- **Performance Optimization**: Numba JIT compilation, vectorized operations, and multiprocessing support
- **Flexible Configuration**: YAML/JSON configs with environment variable overrides
- **Robust Testing**: Unit, integration, and performance tests with > 90% coverage
- **Continuous Integration**: GitHub Actions workflow with testing on multiple Python versions
