# MT 9 EMA Extension Strategy Backtester

Welcome to the documentation for the Multi-Timeframe 9 EMA Extension Strategy Backtester.

## Strategy Overview

The MT 9 EMA Extension Strategy is based on identifying significant price extensions from the 9-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) across multiple timeframes. The strategy uses a hierarchical approach to timeframes, allowing for systematic entry and exit management.

### Key Strategy Components

1. **9 EMA Extension Detection**
   - Identifies when price has extended significantly from the 9 EMA
   - Uses dynamic thresholds based on timeframe volatility
   - Generates extension signals for potential reversal setups

2. **EMA Reclamation**
   - Detects when price returns to and reclaims the 9 EMA after an extension
   - Confirms the end of an extension phase
   - Provides potential entry signals

3. **Fibonacci Pullbacks**
   - Validates entries based on Fibonacci retracement levels
   - Ensures high-probability entry points
   - Optimizes risk-reward ratios

4. **Progressive Targeting**
   - Follows targets through the timeframe hierarchy
   - Uses higher timeframe structures for exit management
   - Maximizes profit potential while managing risk

## Backtester Features

- **Multi-Timeframe Analysis**: Support for any combination of timeframes
- **Customizable Parameters**: Extensive configuration options
- **Performance Metrics**: Comprehensive trade statistics
- **Interactive Visualization**: HTML-based charts and dashboards
- **Optimization Tools**: Parameter testing and optimization

## Getting Started

To get started with the backtester:

1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run a test with the NQ futures data:
   ```
   python run_nq_test.py --mode test
   ```

3. Generate and customize parameters:
   ```
   python run_nq_test.py --generate-params my_params.json
   python run_nq_test.py --params-file my_params.json
   ```

## Operation Modes

- **Test Mode**: Visualize indicators without generating trades
- **Backtest Mode**: Evaluate trading performance with specific parameters
- **Optimize Mode**: Test multiple parameter combinations

## Overview

This project implements a complete backtesting system for a trading strategy based on price extensions from the 9-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) across multiple timeframes. The strategy looks for significant extensions away from the 9 EMA, followed by retracements and reclamations, with confluence across different timeframes.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Timeframe Analysis**: Combines signals from different timeframes (1m â†’ 5m â†’ 10m â†’ 15m â†’ 30m â†’ 1h â†’ 4h â†’ daily â†’ weekly â†’ monthly)
- **Comprehensive Backtesting**: Full P&L calculation, drawdown analysis, and trade statistics
- **Advanced Visualization**: Charts showing entries, exits, equity curve, and key metrics
- **Performance Optimization**: Numba JIT compilation, vectorized operations, and multiprocessing support
- **Flexible Configuration**: YAML/JSON configs with environment variable overrides
- **Robust Testing**: Unit, integration, and performance tests with > 90% coverage
- **Continuous Integration**: GitHub Actions workflow with testing on multiple Python versions
