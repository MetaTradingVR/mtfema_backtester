        * [x] Core visualization components available
        * [x] Foundation for further optimization integration prepared

### Phase 3: Version 1.0 Release Candidate & Polish
*   **Objective:** Integrate all core components, conduct thorough E2E testing, refine UX/UI, and prepare for V1.0 release.
*   **Timeline:** Approx. 3-5 Weeks (following Phase 2 MVP)
*   **Target Completion:** Early December 2025
*   **Key Tasks:**
    *   Seamless backend-frontend integration.
    *   Complete any V1.0 critical pending features (e.g., ZigZag, Laguerre RSI - evaluate necessity).
    *   Extensive E2E testing.
    *   UX/UI refinement based on MVP feedback.
    *   Performance optimization (backend & frontend).
    *   Security review.
    *   Finalize all documentation for V1.0.
    *   Clearly define and meet V1.0 criteria.

    *   Expanded Indicator Library & Custom Indicators.
    *   Cloud Integration.
    *   Mobile PWA enhancements.
    *   Educational Resources.

## 5. Cross-Cutting Concerns (Applicable Throughout)

*   **Python 3.12.6 Stability:** Anchor all development and testing.
*   **CI/CD:** Maintain/enhance GitHub Actions for backend and frontend.
*   **Code Quality:** Enforce linting, formatting, type checking.
*   **Dependency Management:** Regular, cautious review and updates.

## 6. Jupyter Labs Integration & Role

Jupyter Labs serves as a valuable companion tool for this project, primarily for:

*   **Research & Exploratory Data Analysis:** Prototyping new strategy ideas, indicators, or analyzing new datasets.
*   **Custom Analysis:** Performing one-off detailed analyses of backtest results or market data.
*   **Utilizing Core Modules:** The `mtfema_backtester` package should be structured to allow easy import and use of its data handling, indicator calculation, and utility modules within Jupyter notebooks. This facilitates leveraging production-quality code in an exploratory environment.
*   **Interactive Documentation/Examples:** Notebooks can be used to create interactive examples or tutorials for the library components.

Jupyter Labs will not be "migrated into" the core application but will remain a complementary tool in the development and research workflow. Code developed and validated in notebooks that is intended for production should be refactored into the main Python package.
