## üìä Advanced Visualization Features (Added 2025-05-06)

The backtester includes several advanced visualization tools for comprehensive strategy analysis:

### Extension Map
Visualizes extensions across all timeframes with a heatmap interface, making it easy to identify multi-timeframe confluence. Color coding shows extension direction (positive/negative) and intensity.

### Signal Timeline
Displays trading signals chronologically across different timeframes, with markers color-coded by direction (long/short) and sized by confidence level. Offers detailed hover information for in-depth signal analysis.

### Progression Tracker
Shows how trades progress through the timeframe hierarchy using an interactive Sankey diagram. Visualizes the flow from entry timeframe to subsequent target timeframes, with link thickness proportional to frequency.

### Conflict Map
Highlights detected timeframe conflicts with visual indicators for different conflict types (Consolidation, Direct Correction, Trap Setup). Makes it easy to understand where and why risk adjustments were applied.

All visualizations are built with Plotly for modern, interactive display and can be saved as standalone HTML files for sharing or further analysis.

## Installation

### Standard Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/username/mtfema_backtester.git
cd mtfema_backtester

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install TA-Lib (optional but recommended)
# See https://github.com/mrjbq7/ta-lib for platform-specific instructions
```

### Docker Installation

```bash
# Build and run the Docker container
docker-compose up -d

# Run commands inside the container
docker exec mtfema python -m mtfema_backtester.main --help
```

## Using Docker

For a hassle-free setup that avoids dependency issues, you can use Docker to run the backtester:

```bash
# Windows
run-docker-backtest.bat --symbol NQ --timeframes 1d,1h,15m --start-date 2023-01-01 --end-date 2023-06-01

# Linux/Mac
./run-docker-backtest.sh --symbol NQ --timeframes 1d,1h,15m --start-date 2023-01-01 --end-date 2023-06-01
```

The Docker setup provides:
- An isolated environment with all dependencies pre-installed
- Consistent results across different systems
- Volume mounts for data, results, and logs
- Easy customization through command line parameters

You can also customize the Docker settings in `docker-compose.yml` for advanced configurations.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Run a basic backtest
python run_backtest.bat  # Windows
./run_backtest.sh        # Unix/Mac

# With custom parameters
python main.py --symbol ES --start 2023-01-01 --end 2023-12-31 --capital 100000 --risk 0.01
```

## Overview

This backtester is designed to test and optimize the MT 9 EMA Extension Strategy, a sophisticated trading system that capitalizes on price extensions from the 9 EMA across a hierarchical timeframe structure. The strategy systematically identifies, validates, and trades extensions through a progressive targeting framework that moves methodically through the timeframe ladder.

## Features

- **EMA Extension Detection**: Identifies when price extends significantly from the 9 EMA
- **Bollinger Band Analysis**: Volatility measurement and breakout detection
- **Reclamation Detection**: Identifies when price reclaims the EMA and tracks pullbacks
- **Performance Metrics**: Comprehensive trade statistics and equity curve analysis
- **Visualization Tools**: Interactive HTML plots for visual analysis
- **Configurable Parameters**: Extensively customizable strategy parameters
- **Flexible Data Sources**: Supports Yahoo Finance with easy extension to other data providers
