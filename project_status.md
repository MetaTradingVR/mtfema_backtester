## Usage Instructions

### Running the Next.js Dashboard
```bash
# Navigate to the dashboard directory
cd mtfema-dashboard

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev

# Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
```

### Running a Backtest
```bash
python -m mtfema_backtester.main --mode backtest --symbol SPY --start-date 2023-01-01 --end-date 2023-06-30 --save-plots
```

### Viewing Results
Backtest results are stored in `./output/backtest/` directory:
- Equity curve: `{symbol}_equity_curve.csv`
- Trades list: `{symbol}_trades.csv`
- Performance metrics: `{symbol}_metrics.json`
- Interactive plots: `./output/backtest/plots/` (when using `--save-plots`)

### Live Trading
```python
# Create a live trader instance
from mtfema_backtester.trading.live_trader import LiveTrader
from mtfema_backtester.trading.broker_factory import BrokerFactory

# Get broker instance through factory
broker = BrokerFactory.get_broker('tradovate', api_key='your_key', api_secret='your_secret')

# Create live trader
live_trader = LiveTrader(broker=broker, symbols=['ES'], timeframes=['5m', '15m', '1h', '4h'])

# Start trading
live_trader.start()
```

### Docker Usage
```bash
# Build and run using docker-compose
docker-compose up -d

# Run a backtest in the container
docker exec mtfema python -m mtfema_backtester.main --mode backtest --symbol SPY
```
